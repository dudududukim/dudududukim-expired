d2f projects that i'm planning to finish within 1 month (February) 🙂‍↔️

## 🚀 d2f (Temporary Name)
> 📆 24.01.31 ~ 
<br>

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- mlx framework
- python
- etc...

### 🎯 Why Start This?
Since I'm unsure about what I want to be—a businessman, a startup member, a personal developer, or something else—I've been feeling uneasy these days. However, one thing I've realized is that I have a strong desire to solve my own problems or fulfill my own needs by learning new skills, such as AI, circuit design, and system development. Whether intentional or not, I have a day off today, so I'm setting aside my future plans and immersing myself in this project.

**Final goal** is : 
1. making active users with my product
2. finishing with a level of completeness that makes it presentable

Praying for myself 🧯

### Issues

#### 1. mlx.data.buffer_from_vector
error : dictionary로 구성된 sample = [{'image' : b'Path/'}], 이거를 buffer_from_vector를 mlx.data로 실행하면 byte array가 넘어와야하는데, 빈배열이 넘어옴
[] dtype=int8

**Solution** : 
Mac 초기화 -> mlx-data를 pip로 install하지 않고 소스코드에서 python blinding으로 설치함
(환경변수와 다양한 dependency가 꼬여있던 것으로 파단됨)

#### 2.
