d2f projects that i'm planning to finish within 1 month (February) 🙂‍↔️

## 🚀 d2f (Temporary Name)

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- mlx framework
- python
- etc...

### 🎯 Why Start This?
Since I'm unsure about what I want to be—a businessman, a startup member, a personal developer, or something else—I've been feeling uneasy these days. However, one thing I've realized is that I have a strong desire to solve my own problems or fulfill my own needs by learning new skills, such as AI, circuit design, and system development. Whether intentional or not, I have a day off today, so I'm setting aside my future plans and immersing myself in this project.

**Final goal** is : 
1. making active users with my product
2. finishing with a level of completeness that makes it presentable

Praying for myself 🧯
